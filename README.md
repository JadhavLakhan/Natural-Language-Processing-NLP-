# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

# Key applications of NLP include:

Text Processing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in text.

Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.

Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text.

Chatbots & Virtual Assistants: Enabling human-like interactions with AI-powered bots.

Text Summarization: Extracting the most important information from large texts.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying proper names, places, and organizations in text.

NLP techniques range from rule-based approaches to deep learning models like Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT). Advances in NLP continue to improve machine comprehension, making AI more capable of understanding and generating human language.
